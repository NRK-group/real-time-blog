                                To paraphrase the indie band Cracker, what the
                                world needs now is another programming language
                                like I need a hole in the head. That said, Go
                                has slowly but surely inundated the development
                                world like a creeping vine, covering everything
                                that came before it in a lush—and in many ways
                                superior—cover of programming power. With its
                                growing popularity, there are a number of
                                reasons you should take a closer look at it. The
                                story goes that Google engineers designed Go
                                while waiting for other programs to compile.
                                Their frustration at their toolset forced them
                                to rethink system programming from the ground
                                up, creating a lean, mean, and compiled solution
                                that allows for massive multithreading,
                                concurrency, and performance under pressure.
                                Running Go on modern hardware—and even inside
                                containers or on virtual machines—can be a real
                                pleasure. Because Go was designed to run on
                                multiple cores, it is built to support
                                concurrency and scale as cores are added.
                                Further, its multithreading capabilities—most
                                specifically, its goroutines—are a surprising
                                and welcome addition to your bag of tricks.
                                Built for concurrency Before we dig in further,
                                let’s look at goroutines. These are essentially
                                concurrent functions that run while the rest of
                                the program completes. In other words, you can
                                fire off a goroutine, have it run, and keep
                                going while it and thousands of its brethren
                                process in the background. Network timeout?
                                Don’t worry, your goroutine will manage it while
                                the main loop continues. Complete database
                                failure? Your goroutine will know, and you can
                                gracefully work around the issue. Take a look at
                                this simple example: package main import ( "fmt"
                                "time" ) func hello() { fmt.Println("Hello world
                                goroutine") } func main() { go hello()
                                time.Sleep(1 * time.Second) fmt.Println("main
                                function") } Copy and SaveGet Link The main
                                function works just like it does in C. In this
                                code, main fires off a goroutine—indicated by
                                the go keyword—called hello(). The program takes
                                a quick nap and then continues. If anything were
                                to happen in the hello() function, the main
                                function wouldn’t notice. All that’s important
                                is the work is done. The program finishes when
                                the main routine wakes up and fires off a
                                Println. The hello() function could be
                                anything—a data call, a transaction, a queue
                                entry—and it would run while the rest of the
                                program churns along. Like the aforementioned
                                vine, think of goroutines as little flowers that
                                branch off and die while the main vine keeps
                                going. Want to see it in action? Check out this
                                snippet at the Go Playground and you’ll see just
                                how goroutines work. This feature alone is worth
                                the price of admission. For web apps, goroutines
                                let you run concurrent jobs while avoiding
                                roadblocks. If you’re waiting for data input,
                                for example, a goroutine can fire off to supply
                                pre-populated text even as the user is typing.
                                In other words, your program will keep running
                                even if the concurrent processes take longer
                                than expected. Best of all, goroutines are
                                cheap, making Go fast. “The Goroutines are
                                multiplexed to fewer number of OS threads,”
                                wrote Naveen Ramanathan on GoLangBot, a Go
                                learning resource. “There might be only one
                                thread in a program with thousands of
                                Goroutines. If any Goroutine in that thread
                                blocks, say, waiting for user input, then
                                another OS thread is created and the remaining
                                Goroutines are moved to the new OS thread. All
                                these are taken care of by the runtime and we,
                                as programmers, are abstracted from these
                                intricate details and are given a clean API to
                                work with concurrency.” Why should you learn Go?
                                You’ve probably seen some tweets or blogs in
                                recent years arguing that Go is better than
                                Perl/Python/C/etc. We’ve all been using
                                something—heck, I even use command line PHP—to
                                do little things on our servers. Want to watch a
                                log? Perl. Want to send out regular tweets?
                                Python. Want to manage incoming data from
                                thousands of concurrent users? Java or C++ was
                                always your answer. So is Go “better”? Well, Go,
                                can do all of that. Go ensures that your toolbox
                                is compilable across all platforms and on all
                                hardware. It uses a surprisingly simple package
                                management solution that “just works” and it is
                                extremely portable. You can easily replace your
                                scripting languages with Go and your compiled
                                languages will definitely get a run for their
                                money when stacked against Go solutions. Go is
                                built for software engineering today. Not
                                everything new is great, but when a programming
                                language is designed for exactly the environment
                                most of us use right now—scalable, cloud-based
                                servers that are optimized for performance—a lot
                                can go right. Go is compilable on nearly any
                                machine, so you can use it to create a full
                                webapp or a tool to clean up incoming data for
                                processing. Like Perl before it, Go is a Swiss
                                Army knife, but one that has stripped off all of
                                the overhead and extra junk that has accreted
                                onto programming platforms over the past few
                                decades. Go is simple. As a dev, I’ve been able
                                to pick up languages and frameworks over a long
                                weekend. This gives me an understanding of a few
                                important platforms and, since I don’t have to
                                code daily, enough rope to hang myself when it
                                comes to creating little side projects. Go has
                                been different. For folks who already know the
                                basics of programming or a few other languages,
                                learning Go takes a few hours at most. Once you
                                know its tricks, you’re ready to code. Again,
                                because it is so fast, you’ll want to use it for
                                nearly everything you used command line
                                interpreters for, thereby replacing your bash
                                scripts, Python sketches, and Java efforts. Go
                                is fast. Take a look at this clever to-do list
                                in Go by Mohamad Fadhil. The code is quite
                                simple—set up a MySQL database in Docker, add in
                                a bit of HTML, and almost instantly you have a
                                super fast web app that compiles at the command
                                line. What’s more, Fadhil explores why he likes
                                Go in the first place: speed. In a regex
                                test—regex-redux —Go ran in 3.55 seconds while
                                Java ran in 5.58. The Go program weighed in at
                                102 lines of code, while the Java program
                                weighed in at 70. True, Go was a little heftier
                                than Java, but given the speed at which Go
                                bested the next most popular system language,
                                it’s clear you’re not sacrificing speed. Go is
                                on course to take over many open source and
                                private projects and as it becomes more useful
                                as a standard language for both microservices
                                and the web. It could start replacing less
                                performant solutions like Java and C. Don’t take
                                my word for it. Check out GoLang.org for advice
                                on writing web applications, command line tools,
                                and services. “Personally, I believe Go is the
                                new Java. Many open-source projects (e.g.,
                                Jaeger, Kubernetes, Docker, InfluxDB, Serf,
                                etc.) are now written in Go. In contrast, the
                                older projects (e.g., Apache Kafka, Apache
                                Hadoop, Apache Spark, etc.) are written in
                                Java,” wrote Fadhil. Go is like chess or, well,
                                the game of Go: it takes a moment to learn and a
                                lifetime to master. Luckily, unlike chess, Go’s
                                difficulty goes down with experience and soon
                                you’ll be coding fast and furious programs in
                                one of the world’s most modern languages.
